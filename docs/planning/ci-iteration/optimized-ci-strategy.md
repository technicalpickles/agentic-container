# Optimized CI Strategy for Agentic Container

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy to optimize Docker caching and build performance in the agentic-container CI pipeline. The proposed unified workflow eliminates redundant builds, maximizes layer caching, and ensures cookbook extensions are tested before publishing.

## Current State Analysis

### Current Workflows
- `build-and-publish.yml`: Builds and publishes base images
- `test-cookbooks.yml`: Tests cookbook extensions with independent base image builds

### Identified Issues
1. **Redundant Builds**: 8 total builds (2 base + 6 cookbook matrix builds)
2. **No Test Gating**: Images can publish even if cookbook tests fail
3. **Inefficient Caching**: Each cookbook test rebuilds the same base image
4. **Missing Layer Sharing**: Dev variant doesn't optimally reuse standard layers
5. **Branch Confusion**: Workflows reference unused `develop` branch

### Performance Impact
- **Current CI Usage**: ~40-60 runner minutes per push
- **Build Times**: 25-30 min cold, 15-20 min warm
- **Cache Efficiency**: Suboptimal due to parallel redundant builds

## Proposed Optimized Architecture

### Core Strategy: Unified Build-Test-Publish Pipeline

```
Trigger → Lint → Build Standard → (Build Dev + Test Cookbooks) → Publish (main only)
                     ↓                ↓              ↓
              Cache layers    Reuse layers   Use standard image
                                     ↖_____parallel_____↗
```

### Workflow Design

#### Job 1: `lint-and-validation` (2-3 min)
**Purpose**: Fast failure for obvious issues
```yaml
- Hadolint on all Dockerfiles (main, cookbooks, templates)
- YAML validation on goss test files
- Markdown linting (optional)
```

#### Job 2: `build-standard` (8-15 min)
**Purpose**: Build and cache the primary image
```yaml
- Multi-arch build (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
- Aggressive GitHub Actions caching
- Load image locally for testing
- Export image metadata for downstream jobs
```

#### Jobs 3 & 4: `build-dev` + `test-cookbooks` (5-8 min parallel)
**Purpose**: Build dev variant and test cookbooks simultaneously

**Job 3: `build-dev`**
```yaml
- Depends on: build-standard
- Reuses ~80% of layers from standard build
- Only builds dev-specific additions
- Runs in parallel with cookbook tests
```

**Job 4: `test-cookbooks`**
```yaml
- Depends on: build-standard  
- Matrix strategy: 6 cookbooks in parallel
- Uses pre-built standard image (no rebuild!)
- Runs in parallel with dev build
```

#### Job 5: `publish` (3-5 min)
**Purpose**: Publish only after all tests pass
```yaml
- Depends on: build-dev AND test-cookbooks
- Only runs on main branch push
- Publishes both standard and dev variants
- Uses cached builds (no rebuild)
```

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Eliminate Redundant Builds
- **Before**: 8 builds total (2 + 6 matrix)
- **After**: 2 builds total (reused across all jobs)
- **Savings**: 75% reduction in build operations

### 2. Parallel Execution Optimization  
- **Before**: Sequential dev build → cookbook tests (8-13 min total)
- **After**: Parallel dev build + cookbook tests (5-8 min total)
- **Savings**: 3-5 minutes by running tests while dev builds

### 3. Optimal Caching Strategy
```yaml
# Standard build caching
cache-from: |
  type=gha,scope=standard-${{ github.ref_name }}
  type=gha,scope=standard-main
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max,scope=standard-${{ github.ref_name }}

# Dev build caching  
cache-from: |
  type=gha,scope=dev-${{ github.ref_name }}
  type=gha,scope=dev-main
  type=gha,scope=standard-${{ github.ref_name }}
cache-to: type=gha,mode=max,scope=dev-${{ github.ref_name }}
```

### 4. Build Sequencing for Maximum Reuse
1. **Standard First**: Establishes base layer cache
2. **Parallel Phase**: Dev build + cookbook tests run simultaneously
   - **Dev Extends Standard**: Reuses cached layers, only builds delta
   - **Tests Use Standard**: Zero additional build cost
3. **Critical Time Saving**: 5-8 min saved by running dev build and tests in parallel

### 5. Fail-Fast Strategy
- **Lint fails** → Stop immediately (saves ~20 min)
- **Standard build fails** → Stop (saves ~15 min)  
- **Any cookbook test fails** → Block publishing (critical safety)

## Performance Projections

### Build Times
| Scenario | Current | Optimized | Improvement |
|----------|---------|-----------|-------------|
| Cold build | 25-30 min | 18-22 min | 25-30% |
| Warm build | 15-20 min | 10-13 min | 30-40% |
| Incremental | 10-15 min | 6-9 min | 40-50% |

### CI Resource Usage
| Metric | Current | Optimized | Savings |
|--------|---------|-----------|---------|
| Runner minutes/push | 40-60 min | 25-35 min | 35-40% |
| Parallel builds | 8 builds | 2 builds + 6 tests | Efficiency gain |
| Cache utilization | Poor | High | Better performance |

## Risk Assessment

### Risks & Mitigations

**Risk**: Single point of failure if standard build fails
- **Mitigation**: Fast lint step catches most issues early
- **Impact**: Acceptable - better than inconsistent state

**Risk**: Longer feedback time for some test failures  
- **Mitigation**: Parallel test execution minimizes delay
- **Impact**: Minor - consistent with build-then-test pattern

**Risk**: Increased workflow complexity
- **Mitigation**: Clear job dependencies and documentation
- **Impact**: Low - benefits outweigh complexity

### Benefits
1. **Guaranteed Consistency**: Tests always run against published images
2. **Cost Efficiency**: 35-40% reduction in CI costs
3. **Faster Incremental Builds**: Superior cache utilization
4. **Safety**: Impossible to publish untested images

## Branch Strategy Cleanup

### Current State
- Builds on: `main`, `develop`, PRs
- Publishes on: `main`, `develop`
- Tests on: cookbook-related paths

### Proposed State
- **PRs**: Build + test, never publish
- **Main**: Build + test + publish  
- **Remove**: All `develop` references (unused)

### Trigger Optimization
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths-ignore: [ 'docs/**', 'README.md', '*.md' ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths-ignore: [ 'docs/**', 'README.md', '*.md' ]
```

## Technical Implementation Details

### Docker Buildx Configuration
```yaml
- name: Set up Docker Buildx
  uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
  with:
    buildkitd-flags: --allow-insecure-entitlement security.insecure
```

### Cache Strategy Details
- **Scope-based caching**: Separate caches for branches and targets
- **Fallback hierarchy**: Branch → main → clean build  
- **Mode optimization**: `mode=max` for comprehensive layer caching
- **Cache retention**: Leverage GitHub's automatic cleanup

### Matrix Testing Optimization
```yaml
strategy:
  fail-fast: false
  matrix:
    cookbook: [python-cli, nodejs-backend, go-microservices, rails-fullstack, react-frontend, multistage-production]
```

### Image Sharing Strategy
- Use `load: true` for local testing
- Export image tarballs as artifacts if needed
- Leverage Docker layer sharing between jobs

## Questions for Implementation

### Technical Decisions
1. **Cache retention policy**: How long should build caches persist?
2. **Failure handling**: Fail entire pipeline or just block publishing?
3. **Image variants**: Should both standard/dev be required for publish?
4. **Rollback strategy**: Keep old workflow during transition period?

### Performance Tuning
1. **Build parallelization**: Any additional opportunities?
2. **Cache optimization**: Further improvements possible?
3. **Runner sizing**: Would larger runners improve performance?
4. **Network optimization**: Registry proximity considerations?

## Conclusion

This optimized CI strategy addresses the core inefficiencies in the current workflow while ensuring robust testing and safe publishing practices. The unified approach reduces build redundancy by 75%, improves cache utilization, and provides guaranteed consistency between tested and published images.

The projected 35-40% reduction in CI costs, combined with 40-50% faster incremental builds, will significantly improve developer productivity while maintaining the high testing standards established in the current cookbook validation system.

**Next Step**: Implement Phase 1 by creating the optimized workflow and testing it on a feature branch to validate the performance improvements and identify any integration issues.
