# DS026: No HEALTHCHECK defined
# Rationale: All containers in this repository are designed for ephemeral AI agent
# task execution in cloud platforms (Cursor Background Agents, Replit AI, etc.),
# not long-running services. Health checks are not applicable to short-lived
# command execution containers that start, execute a task, and terminate.
#
# - Main Dockerfile: Base image for agent task execution
# - dev Dockerfile: Example kitchen-sink image for prototyping
# - Cookbooks: Extension examples for specific tech stacks
#
# All are designed for "Fast startup time" and "Headless execution" as documented
# in the README, not for service orchestration that would benefit from health monitoring.
